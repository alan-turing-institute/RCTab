Welcome to RCTab
----------------

RCTab is an open-source subscription management and reporting system for Microsoft Azure.
It gives users visibility of their subscriptions' spending via the web front-end and allows administrators to set hard budget limits using the CLI.
With RCTab, you can give users more control over resource creation without spending extra time monitoring costs.

Features
++++++++

* A CLI for administrative tasks.
* A web front-end for admins and end-users.
* Automated deployment with Pulumi.
* Single Sign On with Azure Active Directory.
* Email notifications.

Components
++++++++++

The complete system comprises:

* A web server (A.K.A. the "RCTab API").
* The CLI, which allows command line interaction with the web server.
* Three function apps, which run background jobs to interact with Azure:

  * Usage: Gets usage data from Azure and posts to this API.
  * Status: Gets information about subscriptions from Azure, such as state and RBAC and posts to this API.
  * Controller: Gets list of subscriptions and their desired state from the API and then enables or disables subscriptions on Azure.
* An `authentication library <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/fastapimsal>`_, which handles authentication using Microsoft's MSAL library for FastAPI.
* Logging and alerts.

Important Notice
++++++++++++++++

At the moment, we do not plan to support other cloud service providers (e.g., GCP, AWS, and so on) as the internal workings of subscription and costing varies across cloud platforms. However, we may consider adding support for them in the future. Please get in touch via the repo (open an issue) if you would like to discuss further.
